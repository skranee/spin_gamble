          <h4 id="8">8. How Long Do We Keep your Information?</h4>
          <p>
            In Short: We keep your information for as long as necessary to
            fulfill the purposes outlined in this privacy notice unless
            otherwise required by law.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting or other legal requirements). No purpose in this
            notice will require us keeping your personal information for longer
            than the period of time in which users have an account with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            When we have no ongoing legitimate business need to process your
            personal information, we will either delete or anonymize such
            information, or, if this is not possible (for example, because your
            personal information has been stored in backup archives), then we
            will securely store your personal information and isolate it from
            any further processing until deletion is possible.

            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
            to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
            Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
            100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
            cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
            to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
            your personal information, transmission of personal information to
            and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
            the Services within a secure environment.

            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you

            such, we do not currently respond to DNT browser signals or any
            other mechanism that automatically communicates your choice not to
            be tracked online. If a standard for online tracking is adopted that
            we must follow in the future, we will inform you about that practice
            in a revised version of this privacy notice.

          <span>Verification Process</span>
          <p>
            Upon receiving your request, we will need to verify your identity to
            determine you are the same person about whom we have the information
            in our system. These verification efforts require us to ask you to
            provide information so that we can match it with information you
            have previously provided us. For instance, depending on the type of
            request you submit, we may ask you to provide certain information so
            that we can match the information you provide with the information
            we already have on file, or we may contact you through a
            communication method (e.g. phone or email) that you have previously
            provided to us. We may also use other verification methods as the
            circumstances dictate.
          </p>
          <p>
            We will only use personal information provided in your request to
            verify your identity or authority to make the request. To the extent
            possible, we will avoid requesting additional information from you
            for the purposes of verification. If, however, we cannot verify your
            identity from the information already maintained by us, we may
            request that you provide additional information for the purposes of
            verifying your identity, and for security or fraud-prevention
            purposes. We will delete such additionally provided information as
            soon as we finish verifying you.
